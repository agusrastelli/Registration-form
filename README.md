# Registration Form
Third project for Treehouse Front End Web Development Techdegree. I built a responsive, mobile-friendly registration form using a wide variety of HTML form input types and attributes. Using the supplied mockup files, I built a mobile and desktop version of the form using media queries, and a "mobile-first" approach.

    * Placeholder text has been added to all text inputs and the textarea element.
    * Uses the required attribute to add HTML5 Validation for required fields.
